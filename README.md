## STACK
- ***React Hooks*** 
- ***TypeScript***
- ***Styled-components*** - to simplify working with styles
- ***Eslint / Prettier*** - exclusion of some errors
- ***react-router-dom*** - to organize navigation (including in the browser) between pages

## Why I used that technologies

-  ***React*** <br/>
1. The main advantage of the chosen technology is the ability to create encapsulated components with their own state, and then combine them into complex user interfaces. This was a decisive factor when choosing a technology for team development
2. React creates a cache structure in memory, which allows you to calculate the difference between the previous and current interface states for optimal updating of the browser DOM 
3. Another advantage of React â€” TypeScript XML (TSX) is the extension of TypeScript syntax, which allows you to use HTML-like syntax to describe the structure of the interface

-  ***React Hooks*** 
1. It's easier to share state logic (custom hooks)
2. No need to remember about 'this'
3. Simplification of the logic associated with the lifecycle

- ***TypeScript***
1. Strict typing
2. More OOP features: access modifiers, interfaces, abstract classes, etc.
3. Clearer and more readable code
4. Minimize possible errors

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
